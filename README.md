My personal MERN stack starter boilerplate done with NextJs, so I dont have to type it every time from scratch. It is optimized for server side render React apps. I added simple but efective Todo app just to show all features annd to have setup and test all the routes, and react state management.


> Node, ExpressJs and MongoDB in backend.

> NextJs used to connect it all

> Frontend is latest React with Hooks, useContext with useReducer instead of Redux. Css Modules and css variables included.
